# Biology-Simulation

A simulation of natural selection i built. The model simulates entities with only one gene-pair. Whether the entity's is homozygous recessive or dominant, or heterozygous determines its allocated speed and energy level.

At the beginning of a simulation all entities are spawned at the side of a grid. Subsequently, all entites try to get a piece of food randomly distributed in the grid. Entities that get no food die, entities that get one piece survives, and entities that get multiple pieces mate. This leads to a composition that is the most efficient possible. Changes to the simulation can be made in the Settings.py file.
